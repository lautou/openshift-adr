**Issue or Problem**
Determining the number and purpose of OpenShift AI instances impacts resource allocation, operational complexity, and the ability to isolate production, non-production, and testing workloads. Too few instances may lead to conflicts between environments, while too many could strain infrastructure and increase management overhead.

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Two Instances Model
- Three Instances Model
- Flexible Choice with Sandbox

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Two Instances Model:** For minimal setup with a sandbox for safe testing and a production instance for operations.
- **Three Instances Model:** For clear separation of production, non-production, and sandbox environments, reducing interference risks.
- **Flexible Choice with Sandbox:** For adaptability to organizational needs, ensuring a sandbox for testing without user impact.

**Implications**

- **Two Instances Model:** Requires moderate management effort; demands two separate deployments with sandbox testing capability, potentially limiting non-production flexibility.

## RHOAI-SM-03: Environment connectivity

**Architectural Question**
Should Red Hat OpenShift AI Self-Managed be deployed in a connected or disconnected environment?

**Issue or Problem**
The environment’s internet connectivity impacts access to external resources (e.g., container images, updates) and security requirements. A connected environment requires internet access, while a disconnected environment must operate without it. (Aligns with OCP-BASE-07).

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Connected Environment
- Disconnected Environment

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Connected Environment:** For simplicity in accessing external resources, ideal for rapid deployment.
- **Disconnected Environment:** To ensure security and compliance, critical for sensitive or isolated setups.

**Implications**

- **Connected Environment:** Increases security monitoring needs; enables direct resource pulls (e.g., images, updates), speeding setup.
- **Disconnected Environment:** Demands manual update processes and skilled admins; requires mirroring resources (e.g., images to local registry), adding setup time. (See RHOAI-SM-04).

## RHOAI-SM-04: Mirror registry (disconnected environment)

**Architectural Question**
If deploying in a disconnected environment, what mirror registry will be used for RHOAI components?

**Issue or Problem**
In a disconnected environment (RHOAI-SM-03), a mirror registry is essential for providing OpenShift AI with access to container images and operators. The choice of registry impacts availability, scalability, and integration. (Aligns with OCP-BASE-08).

**Assumption**
OpenShift cluster is in a disconnected environment.

**Alternatives**

- Use OCP Mirror Registry (Filesystem-based or Dedicated)
- Dedicated RHOAI-Specific Mirror (if different from OCP)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Use OCP Mirror Registry:** To leverage the same mirror registry infrastructure used for the underlying OpenShift platform (as decided in OCP-BASE-08), ensuring consistency and simplifying mirror management.
- **Dedicated RHOAI-Specific Mirror:** To maintain a separate mirror registry specifically for RHOAI components, potentially for organizational separation or different update cadences. Generally increases complexity.

**Implications**

- **Use OCP Mirror Registry:** Simplifies overall disconnected setup. Requires ensuring the OCP mirror contains all necessary RHOAI images and catalogs. Update process is unified.
- **Dedicated RHOAI-Specific Mirror:** Increases infrastructure footprint and management overhead. Requires managing two separate mirroring processes and ensuring network connectivity between RHOAI installation sources and its dedicated mirror.

## RHOAI-SM-05: Identity provider Integration

**Architectural Question**
Which OpenShift identity provider (IdP) will be used to authenticate users accessing Red Hat OpenShift AI?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift AI relies entirely on the OpenShift platform's configured authentication mechanism (OCP-SEC-03). The choice of IdP affects user login experience, integration with enterprise directories, group management for RBAC, and overall security posture for RHOAI users.

**Assumption**
An appropriate OpenShift IdP must be configured (see OCP-SEC-03).

**Alternatives**

- Leverage Configured OpenShift IdP (HTPasswd, LDAP, OIDC/OAuth)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Leverage Configured OpenShift IdP:** RHOAI integrates directly with the IdP configured at the OpenShift cluster level. The justification aligns with the choice made in OCP-SEC-03 (e.g., simplicity for HTPasswd, enterprise integration for LDAP, modern features/SSO for OIDC).

**Implications**

- The implications are inherited from the OCP-SEC-03 decision. RHOAI dashboard and components utilize the OpenShift OAuth proxy flow, meaning user authentication is handled transparently based on the cluster's IdP configuration. Group synchronization (OCP-SEC-04) becomes important for managing RHOAI roles (RHOAI-SM-06).

## RHOAI-SM-06: User/Group Dashboard Access Configuration

**Architectural Question**
How will access to the OpenShift AI dashboard be controlled based on user groups?

**Issue or Problem**
By default, any authenticated OpenShift user can access the RHOAI dashboard. A mechanism is needed to restrict access to specific administrator and standard user groups defined in OpenShift, aligning with RBAC best practices.

**Assumption**
Access to the OpenShift AI dashboard must be restricted based on OpenShift user groups. OpenShift groups are synchronized or defined (OCP-SEC-04). RHOAI IdP integration is confirmed (RHOAI-SM-05).

**Alternatives**

- Configure Access via `Auth` Resource (Recommended)
- Use Default Unrestricted Access (Not Recommended for Production)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Configure Access via `Auth` Resource:** To manage RHOAI dashboard administrator and standard user access by defining the corresponding OpenShift group names in the dedicated `Auth` custom resource (`dscinitialization_odscustomizations_console_auth`). This is the standard, supported method.
- **Use Default Unrestricted Access:** To allow any authenticated OpenShift user to access the OpenShift AI dashboard without explicit group membership checks. Simplifies initial setup but lacks role separation.

**Implications**

- **Configure Access via `Auth` Resource:** Requires identifying or creating appropriate OpenShift groups (e.g., `rhods-admins`, `rhods-users`) and configuring the `Auth` resource (typically via GitOps overlay) to reference them. Enforces role separation (admins see admin settings, users see user view). Requires group sync or manual group management in OpenShift.
- **Use Default Unrestricted Access:** Simplest setup, no group configuration needed. Provides limited security segmentation; all authenticated users can log in, potentially seeing inappropriate options or consuming resources without oversight. Not suitable for multi-tenant or production environments.

## RHOAI-SM-07: OpenShift AI Namespace Strategy (Core Components)

**Architectural Question**
What namespace strategy will be used for deploying OpenShift AI core components?

**Issue or Problem**
Red Hat OpenShift AI Self-Managed uses default projects (`redhat-ods-operator`, `redhat-ods-applications`), but enterprise environments often require custom names for standardization or compliance. This decision focuses on the core platform namespaces, distinct from user workload namespaces (RHOAI-SM-13).

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Use Default RHOAI Namespaces (Core Components)
- Configure Custom Namespaces for RHOAI Core Components

**Decision**
#TODO: Document the decision for each cluster.#

**Justification**

- **Use Default RHOAI Namespaces:** To simplify installation and maintenance by accepting the standard naming (`redhat-ods-*`). Aligns directly with documentation and default operator behavior.
- **Configure Custom Namespaces for RHOAI Core:** To adhere to strict organizational naming conventions by specifying custom project names for the core RHOAI operator and application components during installation via the `DataScienceCluster` CR.

**Implications**

- **Use Default Namespaces:** Easiest setup. May not meet strict naming policies.
- **Configure Custom Core Namespaces:** Requires defining custom names via `DataScienceCluster` CR _before_ initial installation. Ensures compliance with naming standards for platform components but adds configuration steps. Does not affect the default `rhods-notebooks` namespace unless also customized.

## RHOAI-SM-08: CA Certificate management

**Architectural Question**
Which CA certificate bundle will be used for Red Hat OpenShift AI components, and how will its lifecycle be managed?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift AI components require trusted CA certificates for secure TLS communication (internal and external). Choosing the bundle and manager affects trust scope, integration effort, and operational consistency.

**Assumption**
Secure communication using TLS is required.

**Alternatives**

- Managed by RHOAI Operator (Legacy/Compatibility Mode)
- Externally Managed (`managementState: Removed`, Recommended)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Managed by RHOAI Operator:** To have the OpenShift AI Operator automatically manage a `trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap. Simpler initial setup but less control and potentially conflicts with cluster-wide trust.
- **Externally Managed (`managementState: Removed`):** Recommended approach (RHOAI 2.25+). The operator does not manage the CA bundle. Trust is handled externally (e.g., via cluster-wide proxy settings, injected CAs via ConfigMaps referenced by workloads, service mesh trust). Offers better security separation and aligns with standard cluster practices.

**Implications**

- **Managed by RHOAI Operator:** Operator manages `trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap. Provides automatic trust injection for managed components but increases operator scope and potential conflicts.
- **Externally Managed/Removed:** Requires administrators to ensure necessary CAs are trusted via other mechanisms (cluster proxy, manual ConfigMaps, service mesh). More initial effort but clearer separation of concerns, less operator complexity. Preferred long-term.

## RHOAI-SM-09: S3 Object Storage Location

**Architectural Question**
Will S3-compatible object storage be used for OpenShift AI, and if so, where will it be hosted?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift AI requires S3-compatible object storage for model serving artifacts (KServe) and Data Science Pipelines intermediate data. The choice of provider impacts integration, cost, latency, and management.

**Assumption**
Model serving (RHOAI-SM-27) and/or Data Science Pipelines (RHOAI-SM-33) capabilities are required.

**Alternatives**

- OpenShift Data Foundation (MCG) On-Cluster
- External Cloud Provider S3 Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob, GCP)
- External Dedicated S3 Storage (e.g., MinIO, Ceph RGW On-Prem)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **OpenShift Data Foundation (MCG):** To utilize integrated, on-cluster object storage provided by ODF (if deployed, OCP-STOR-01 / ODF-BASE-02), optimizing data co-location and simplifying platform storage management.
- **External Cloud Provider S3:** To leverage native cloud services for scalability, durability, and managed features (less relevant for on-prem context unless hybrid connectivity exists).
- **External Dedicated S3:** To utilize an existing, dedicated, enterprise-grade S3 solution (on-prem or private cloud) for centralized storage management outside the OCP cluster lifecycle.

**Implications**

- **OpenShift Data Foundation (MCG):** Requires ODF installation/configuration. Ensures low-latency access within cluster. Requires sizing ODF appropriately. Adds MCG resource overhead.
- **External Cloud Provider S3:** Requires external connectivity and secure credential management. Offloads S3 management. Cost based on provider.
- **External Dedicated S3:** Requires configuring external connectivity and secure credentials. Performance depends on network. Offloads S3 management to separate team/system.

## RHOAI-SM-10: Default storage class for Red Hat OpenShift AI components

**Architectural Question**
Which default storage class (StorageClass) will be configured for use by Red Hat OpenShift AI components requiring dynamic Persistent Volume provisioning?

**Issue or Problem**
Components like workbenches automatically create PVCs and rely on a cluster-defined default `StorageClass`. The selected default affects performance, access modes (RWO/RWX), and capacity management for these components.

**Assumption**
Dynamic volume provisioning is used. Components like Workbenches (RHOAI-SM-14) will require PVCs.

**Alternatives**

- Use Existing Cluster Default StorageClass
- Designate a Specific RHOAI Default StorageClass

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Use Existing Cluster Default:** Simplest approach, leveraging the pre-configured default `StorageClass` if it meets RHOAI's needs (e.g., provides reliable RWO block storage).
- **Designate a Specific RHOAI Default:** Explicitly choose/create a `StorageClass` (e.g., from ODF, OCP-STOR-01 / ODF-BASE-01) and mark it as default (`storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"`), ensuring RHOAI components use the desired backend. Requires cluster-admin privilege.

**Implications**

- **Use Existing Cluster Default:** RHOAI storage characteristics depend entirely on the cluster default. May not be optimal (e.g., slow performance). Easiest initial setup.
- **Designate Specific RHOAI Default:** Ensures RHOAI components (like workbench PVCs) use intended storage (e.g., ODF `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd`). Requires administrative action to set default. **Important:** Changing the default affects _all_ workloads cluster-wide that don't specify an explicit `storageClassName`.

## RHOAI-SM-11: Usage data collection (Telemetry)

**Architectural Question**
Will you enable usage data collection (telemetry) for Red Hat OpenShift AI?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift AI Self-Managed can optionally send anonymized usage data to Red Hat to help improve the product. Enabling this affects privacy considerations, connectivity requirements (if connected), and compliance policies.

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Enable Sending Usage Data to Red Hat
- Disable Sending Usage Data to Red Hat

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Sending Usage Data:** To contribute usage statistics that help Red Hat understand product usage patterns and prioritize improvements. May facilitate proactive support.
- **Disable Sending Usage Data:** To maintain strict data isolation, comply with privacy regulations, or operate in disconnected environments (RHOAI-SM-03).

**Implications**

- **Enable Sending Usage Data:** Requires outbound internet connectivity (if cluster is connected) to Red Hat's telemetry endpoints. Data is typically anonymized configuration and usage metrics. May require security/privacy review.
- **Disable Sending Usage Data:** Ensures no data leaves the cluster for telemetry. Requires explicitly setting `spec.telemetry.enabled: false` in the `DataScienceCluster` CR. Necessary for disconnected environments.

**(Start of User Environment Section)**

## RHOAI-SM-13: Data science project allocation strategy (User Namespaces)

**Architectural Question**
How will OpenShift Projects (Kubernetes Namespaces) be allocated and used for data science activities (workbenches, pipelines, models)?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift Projects provide isolation (resources, RBAC, network, quotas). The allocation strategy impacts multi-tenancy, resource management, security, and collaboration. (Aligns with OCP-MGT-01).

**Assumption**
Data science workloads need namespace isolation beyond the core RHOAI components (RHOAI-SM-07).

**Alternatives**

- Single Shared Data Science Project (e.g., default `rhods-notebooks`)
- Project per Team/Group
- Project per ML Project/Initiative
- Hybrid (e.g., Shared for experimentation, dedicated for production)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Single Shared Project:** Simplest, often uses default `rhods-notebooks`. Users share resources/RBAC. Suitable for small teams/pilots.
- **Project per Team/Group:** Isolation between DS teams. Allows team-specific RBAC, quotas, network policies. Promotes autonomy.
- **Project per ML Project/Initiative:** Highest isolation (per model/problem). Facilitates project-specific resource tracking/security.
- **Hybrid:** Shared space for experimentation, dedicated/controlled namespaces for critical pipelines/serving.

**Implications**

- **Single Shared:** Higher risk of resource contention (needs quotas, OCP-MGT-04). Complex internal RBAC/NetworkPolicy. Hard to track usage per initiative.
- **Project per Team:** Increases namespace count. Requires automation for project creation/config. Clearer resource/security boundaries per team.
- **Project per ML Project:** Largest number of namespaces, needs high automation. Granular control/chargeback.
- **Hybrid:** Balances flexibility/control but needs clear promotion processes between shared/dedicated namespaces.

- Red Hat Provided ROCm Images (if AMD GPUs enabled, RHOAI-SM-25)
- Red Hat Provided Intel Images (if Intel accelerators enabled, RHOAI-SM-24 / RHOAI-SM-26)
- Open Data Hub (ODH) Community Images
- Custom-Built Images (Derived from Red Hat/ODH)
- Combination of Above

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Red Hat Provided Standard/CUDA/ROCm/Intel Images:** Use officially supported, certified images ensuring compatibility. Accelerator-specific images are necessary for GPU/HPU workloads.
- **ODH Community Images:** Leverage wider variety from upstream ODH (community support).
- **Custom-Built Images:** Create tailored environments with specific libraries/drivers/tools pre-installed for consistency/project needs.
- **Combination:** Offer a mix (supported base + custom) for flexibility.

**Implications**

- **Red Hat Provided:** Limited customization (users install packages at runtime). Updates managed via RHOAI upgrades. Consistent, supported baseline.
- **ODH Community:** More options but no official Red Hat support. Requires vetting. Community-dependent updates.
- **Custom-Built:** Max control/standardization. Requires build pipeline (Pipelines, Jenkins, etc.), dependency management, security scanning, updates. Increases maintenance. (See RHOAI-SM-15, RHOAI-SM-16).
- **Combination:** Flexibility but needs governance on support/management of custom images.

**Assumption**
Custom notebook images will be built (Decision from RHOAI-SM-14).

**Alternatives**

- Minimal Common Set (e.g., visualization, data manipulation extensions)
- Domain-Specific Sets (e.g., NLP, CV, Time Series)
- Framework-Specific Sets (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost variants)
- Comprehensive Custom Set (Mixing multiple domains/frameworks)
- Allow Runtime Installation Only (No custom packages baked-in)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Minimal Common Set:** Provide generally useful tools with minimal bloat.
- **Domain/Framework-Specific Sets:** Create optimized, tailored images, reducing size/conflicts.
- **Comprehensive Custom Set:** Build 'kitchen-sink' image for convenience, potentially large/complex.
- **Runtime Installation Only:** Simplest custom image (base only), users install via pip/conda in workbench.

**Implications**

- **Baking Packages:** Ensures consistency/reproducibility. Reduces user startup time. Requires managing dependencies, rebuilding images for updates. Increases image size. Security scanning critical.
- **Domain/Framework-Specific:** Multiple images to manage, but tailored/smaller environments.
- **Runtime Installation Only:** Smallest images. Max user flexibility but risks inconsistencies. Users need internet/mirrors for install. Increases workbench setup time.

**Assumption**
Custom notebook images will be built (Decision from RHOAI-SM-14).

**Alternatives**

- Existing HA Corporate Registry (e.g., Quay, Artifactory, Nexus)
- OpenShift Internal Registry (Image Registry Operator)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Existing HA Corporate Registry:** Leverage existing enterprise registry for central storage, governance (scanning, signing), availability, scalability. Aligns with existing practices.
- **OpenShift Internal Registry:** Store images within the cluster. Simplifies network access (no external pulls), optimizes pull times, reduces external dependencies.

**Implications**

- **Existing HA Corporate Registry:** Requires network connectivity. Pull secrets needed in workbench namespaces. Build pipelines need push access. Integrates with existing security scanning/signing.
- **OpenShift Internal Registry:** Requires configuring internal registry with persistent storage (ODF RWO/RWX or other PVs, OCP-STOR-01). Lifecycle tied to cluster. Build pipelines within cluster can easily push. May need separate security scanning setup.

## RHOAI-SM-17: Workbenches provisioning strategy

**Architectural Question**
How will workbenches (JupyterLab or other IDE environments) be provisioned and managed for data scientists?

**Issue or Problem**
Workbenches are the primary IDE. The provisioning strategy impacts resource allocation (CPU, memory, PVCs, GPUs), user experience, environment consistency, and cost.

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Individual Workbench per User (Self-Service)
- Shared Team Workbenches
- Role/Task-Specific Workbench Configurations (e.g., GPU vs. CPU)

**Decision**

**Issue or Problem**
RHOAI allows enabling `code-server` as an alternative IDE, offering a VS Code experience. However, it's often Tech Preview, may lack full integration (e.g., Elyra, RHOAI-SM-34), and uses a different base image.

**Assumption**
Red Hat notebook server images (RHOAI-SM-14) are used. Workbenches are provisioned (RHOAI-SM-17).

**Alternatives**

- Enable Code-Server Workbench Option
- Disable Code-Server Workbench Option (JupyterLab Only)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Code-Server:** Provide VS Code users an alternative IDE, potentially better for extensive scripting or specific extensions.
- **Disable Code-Server:** Standardize on JupyterLab, ensuring full feature compatibility (Elyra) and simplifying available image options.

**Implications**

- **Enable Code-Server:** Makes `code-server` image available. Users get VS Code but may lose Jupyter-specific integrations (Elyra). Often requires enabling Tech Preview features in `DataScienceCluster` CR.
- **Disable Code-Server:** Simplifies user choice, ensures all users get fully integrated JupyterLab. Reduces number of base images to manage/customize.

**Issue or Problem**
Workbench PVC size impacts local data storage capacity and overall cluster storage consumption.

**Assumption**
Workbenches are configured (RHOAI-SM-17). Local PVC storage is used (RHOAI-SM-20).

**Alternatives**

- Fixed Default Size for All Workbenches
- User-Selectable Size (within pre-defined limits/tiers)
- Custom Size per Workbench (Admin controlled)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Fixed Default Size:** Simplest administration. Consistent starting point (e.g., 20Gi).
- **User-Selectable Size:** Flexibility for users to choose based on needs (e.g., Small-20Gi, Medium-50Gi, Large-100Gi).
- **Custom Size:** Most flexible but requires manual intervention/automation by admins.

**Implications**

- **Fixed Default:** May be insufficient for large local datasets/libraries. Users might hit limits. Easiest capacity planning.
- **User-Selectable:** Balances flexibility/control. Needs defined tiers and potentially project quotas (OCP-MGT-04). Users need guidance.
- **Custom:** High admin overhead unless automated. Precise allocation but complicates capacity management.

**Architectural Question**
Will the Data Science Pipelines component (based on Kubeflow Pipelines with Tekton backend) be enabled within RHOAI?

**Issue or Problem**
Enabling Data Science Pipelines provides a framework for orchestrating multi-step ML workflows. It requires specific configuration (database, object storage) and impacts the tools available to MLOps engineers. (Related to PIPELINES-01 for broader CI/CD strategy).

**Assumption**
Orchestration of ML workflows is required.

**Alternatives**

- Enable Data Science Pipelines Component
- Disable Data Science Pipelines Component (Rely on OpenShift Pipelines/Tekton or external orchestrators)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Data Science Pipelines:** To provide an integrated, UI-driven (via RHOAI dashboard and Elyra) and SDK-driven platform specifically designed for defining, running, and managing ML pipelines within OpenShift AI. Uses Kubeflow Pipelines API standard with Tekton execution.
- **Disable Data Science Pipelines:** To simplify the RHOAI deployment if ML pipeline orchestration is handled by other tools (e.g., standard OpenShift Pipelines/Tekton for simpler CI/CD-like tasks, external orchestrators like Airflow, or if not required initially).

**Implications**

- **Enable Data Science Pipelines:** Installs KFP/Tekton components. Requires configuring a database backend (RHOAI-SM-29) and S3 object storage (RHOAI-SM-09). Enables Elyra usage (RHOAI-SM-28). Consumes additional cluster resources. Provides ML-specific pipeline features (artifact tracking, metadata).
- **Disable Data Science Pipelines:** Reduces RHOAI footprint and dependencies. Users needing pipeline orchestration must use alternative tools. Elyra extension in JupyterLab will not function for pipeline submission.

Elyra provides a UI within JupyterLab for building KFP/Tekton pipelines visually. Enabling it requires compatible notebook images and impacts user workflow.

**Assumption**
Data Science Pipelines component is enabled (RHOAI-SM-27). Users primarily use JupyterLab (RHOAI-SM-17/RHOAI-SM-18).

**Alternatives**

- Enable and Promote Elyra Usage
- Disable or Do Not Promote Elyra (Use KFP SDK Primarily)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Elyra:** Provide intuitive visual tool for pipeline construction in Jupyter, lowering barrier to entry.
- **Disable Elyra:** Standardize on programmatic pipeline definition using KFP SDK directly in code. Offers more flexibility/control for complex pipelines but needs more coding expertise.

**Implications**

- **Enable Elyra:** Requires notebook images including Elyra (most standard RHOAI images do, RHOAI-SM-14). Simplifies pipeline creation. Generated pipeline is KFP/Tekton compatible. Some advanced KFP features might not be exposed via UI.
- **Disable Elyra:** Users define pipelines entirely via KFP SDK (Python). Requires SDK in notebook images. Provides full access to all KFP features but steeper learning curve.

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Internal MariaDB:** Simplicity/ease of setup. RHOAI auto-deploys MariaDB within cluster. Suitable for non-prod or smaller scale.
- **External MySQL/MariaDB:** Production environments needing higher scalability, reliability, integration with existing DB backup/management. Leverages external, potentially HA database.

**Implications**

- **Internal MariaDB:** Simplest deployment. Runs as pods, consumes cluster resources. Data on PVC; persistence/backup depend on cluster storage/backup strategy (RHOAI-SM-40). May not scale for very high throughput.
- **External MySQL/MariaDB:** Requires provisioning/managing separate DB instance. RHOAI Pipelines need connection details config. Offloads DB management but adds external dependency. Allows leveraging enterprise DB features (HA, backup, monitoring).

## RHOAI-SM-30: Distributed workloads enablement (Ray/CodeFlare)

**Architectural Question**
Will the capability for distributed AI/ML workloads using Ray (via CodeFlare/KubeRay) be enabled?

**Issue or Problem**
RHOAI includes operators for temporary Ray clusters (distributed data processing/training). Enabling impacts cluster resources, dependencies, complexity.

**Assumption**
Workloads might benefit from distributed computation.

**Alternatives**

- Enable Distributed Workloads (CodeFlare/KubeRay)
- Disable Distributed Workloads

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Distributed Workloads:** Allow data scientists to scale computationally intensive tasks (large data preprocessing, distributed training) across multiple nodes using Ray framework.
- **Disable Distributed Workloads:** Simplicity/resource conservation if workloads don't require distributed compute beyond single-node (multi-core/GPU).

**Implications**

- **Enable Distributed Workloads:** Installs CodeFlare/KubeRay operators. Requires additional cluster resources (~1.6 vCPU, ~2 GiB RAM for operators minimum). Users define/launch Ray clusters (`AppWrapper` or `RayCluster` CRs). Requires configuring security (Ray dashboard certs). Adds complexity but enables performance gains for suitable workloads. Enables RHOAI-SM-31, RHOAI-SM-32, RHOAI-SM-33.
- **Disable Distributed Workloads:** Reduces operators/resources consumed by RHOAI. Simplifies platform but limits ability to scale certain tasks horizontally.

## RHOAI-SM-31: Quota management for distributed workloads (Kueue)

**Architectural Question**
How will resource quotas and scheduling for distributed workloads (Ray clusters via CodeFlare) be managed?

**Issue or Problem**
Distributed workloads (Ray clusters) consume significant resources. RHOAI integrates Kueue for batch scheduling/resource quota management specifically for these, preventing cluster saturation. Configuration impacts resource sharing/prioritization.

**Assumption**
Distributed workloads (CodeFlare/KubeRay) are enabled (RHOAI-SM-30).

**Alternatives**

- Enable Kueue Integration (Recommended)
- Disable Kueue Integration (Rely on OpenShift Quotas only)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Kueue:** Leverage Kueue's batch scheduling (fair sharing, prioritization) and resource quotas (`ClusterQueue`, `LocalQueue`) designed for managing ephemeral, high-resource jobs like Ray clusters. Finer control than standard OpenShift quotas.
- **Disable Kueue:** Rely solely on standard OpenShift ResourceQuotas at namespace level (OCP-MGT-04). Simpler setup but lacks advanced scheduling features.

**Implications**

- **Enable Kueue:** Installs Kueue operator. Requires configuring `ClusterQueue` (overall resources) and potentially `LocalQueue`s (user namespace subdivision). Adds scheduling overhead but better control over resource-intensive batch jobs.
- **Disable Kueue:** Simplifies installation. Ray cluster consumption limited only by standard OCP quotas, risking resource exhaustion/unfair distribution with concurrent large jobs. Lacks queuing/prioritization.

## RHOAI-SM-32: Authentication Method for Ray Dashboard

**Architectural Question**
Which authentication method will be used to secure access to the Ray Dashboard associated with distributed Ray clusters?

**Issue or Problem**
The Ray Dashboard needs protection. RHOAI supports integrating it with OpenShift OAuth (SSO) or alternative methods.

**Assumption**
Distributed workloads (CodeFlare/KubeRay) are enabled (RHOAI-SM-30).

**Alternatives**

- OpenShift OAuth Integration (Default/Recommended)
- Custom/No Integrated Authentication

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **OpenShift OAuth:** Leverage cluster's existing authentication for seamless/secure access based on OpenShift user/RBAC. Simplifies user management.
- **Custom/No Auth:** Use alternative methods (Ray's own, or unprotected in trusted envs). Flexible but potentially less secure or more config effort.

**Implications**

- **OpenShift OAuth:** Requires configuring OCP OAuth details in Ray cluster definition (often handled by CodeFlare defaults). Access controlled via OCP login/roles. May need cert handling for custom cluster CAs.
- **Custom/No Auth:** Bypasses OCP login for dashboard. Requires manual Ray security config or accepts lower security. Simpler in isolated test envs, not recommended for prod.

## RHOAI-SM-33: Distributed workloads monitoring (Ray)

**Architectural Question**
Will monitoring be enabled for distributed workloads (Ray clusters)?

**Issue or Problem**
Monitoring Ray clusters provides visibility (resource usage, job status) but requires enabling OpenShift User Workload Monitoring (UWM) and ensuring Ray metrics are scraped, impacting resources/configuration. (Aligns with OCP-MON-01).

**Assumption**
Distributed workloads (CodeFlare/KubeRay) are enabled (RHOAI-SM-30).

**Alternatives**

- Enable Ray Monitoring via UWM
- Disable Ray Monitoring

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Ray Monitoring:** Collect metrics from Ray clusters (resource utilization, task status), integrate into OpenShift Monitoring (Grafana) for observability. Essential for performance/troubleshooting.
- **Disable Ray Monitoring:** Simpler deployment, reduced resource use if detailed Ray metrics aren't needed (rely on basic pod metrics, logs, Ray Dashboard).

**Implications**

- **Enable Ray Monitoring:** Requires enabling User Workload Monitoring (UWM) in cluster (OCP-MON-01). Consumes Prometheus resources for scraping/storing Ray metrics. Ray cluster defs need annotations/labels for scraping. Provides valuable operational insights.
- **Disable Ray Monitoring:** Reduces monitoring overhead/resource use. Limits visibility into Ray cluster internal state/performance, making troubleshooting harder.

**(Start of Model Serving Section)**

## RHOAI-SM-34: Model Serving Platform Selection

**Architectural Question**
Which model serving platform architecture will be used in Red Hat OpenShift AI?

**Issue or Problem**
A decision is needed on the technology for deploying models as scalable endpoints, affecting dependencies, resources, complexity, and features (e.g., scale-to-zero).

**Assumption**
Model deployment capabilities are required.

**Alternatives**

- KServe (Single Model Serving / RawDeployment Mode)
- Custom Application Deployment (OpenShift Deployments)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **KServe (RawDeployment Mode):** Deploy each model as a separate, scalable endpoint optimized for AI/ML using integrated KServe. Leverages standardized inference protocols, model management, observability. RawDeployment avoids reliance on OpenShift Serverless.
- **Custom Application Deployment:** Use standard OpenShift methods (`Deployment`, `Service`) for model endpoints, wrapping model in custom container. Max control over Kubernetes primitives but requires building more infrastructure manually.

**Implications**

- **KServe (RawDeployment Mode):** Requires KServe components (Operator, Controller). Relies on Istio Service Mesh for advanced traffic management. Provides standardized MLOps workflow but abstracts some K8s details. RawDeployment ensures compatibility/avoids deprecated Serverless dependencies.
- **Custom Application Deployment:** Requires developers to build container images with serving logic (Flask/FastAPI) and manually create K8s resources (`Deployment`, `Service`, `Route`, `HPA`). Lacks specialized KServe features (standardized metrics, easy canary) unless implemented manually.

## RHOAI-SM-35: Authorization provider for KServe Model Serving

**Architectural Question**
Will an authorization provider (Authorino) be used for KServe single-model serving endpoints?

**Issue or Problem**
KServe endpoints may need fine-grained authorization beyond basic OpenShift RBAC. Using Authorino (integrated with Istio) impacts security granularity and complexity. Skipping it relies on simpler OpenShift/Istio mechanisms.

**Assumption**
Single-model serving platform (KServe) is enabled (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- Use Authorino for KServe Authorization
- Do Not Use Authorino (Rely on OpenShift RBAC/Istio Policy)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Use Authorino:** Enable dynamic, policy-based, fine-grained authorization (OIDC tokens, API keys, JWT claims) for accessing served models, enhancing endpoint security.
- **Do Not Use Authorino:** Simpler authorization management, relying on native OpenShift RBAC and standard Istio authorization policies for basic access control.

**Implications**

- **Use Authorino:** Requires Authorino Operator installation/configuration. Needs expertise in Authorino `AuthConfig` policies and Istio integration. Increases complexity but provides robust, flexible authorization.
- **Do Not Use Authorino:** Reduces admin overhead/dependencies. Authorization relies on standard K8s/Istio mechanisms, possibly offering less granularity.

## RHOAI-SM-36: Model-serving runtime for KServe

**Architectural Question**
Which specific model serving runtime(s) will be primarily used within the KServe single-model serving platform?

**Issue or Problem**
KServe supports various runtimes for different model formats and optimizations (LLMs, ONNX, scikit-learn). Selecting runtimes determines which models can be served and how efficiently.

**Assumption**
Single-model serving platform (KServe) is enabled (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- RHOAI Custom Runtimes (Caikit+TGIS based, default for LLMs)
- KServe Core Runtimes (e.g., SKLearnServer, XGBoostServer, PMMLServer)
- vLLM Runtime (via KServe Custom Runtime - for high-throughput LLM inference)
- OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS) Runtime (via KServe Custom Runtime - optimized for Intel)
- NVIDIA Triton Inference Server (via KServe Custom Runtime - GPU-focused, multi-format)
- Custom-Built Runtimes

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **RHOAI Custom (Caikit+TGIS):** Use default RHOAI runtime, optimized for LLMs with Caikit framework/TGIS.
- **KServe Core:** Leverage standard runtimes for common formats (scikit-learn, XGBoost, PMML).
- **vLLM:** Achieve high throughput/low latency LLM inference via specialized vLLM engine (custom runtime).
- **OVMS:** Optimize inference performance, particularly on Intel hardware (CPU, GPU, VPU) (custom runtime).
- **Triton:** Use NVIDIA's flexible inference server (multiple frameworks, NVIDIA GPU optimized) (custom runtime).
- **Custom-Built:** Support niche formats or bespoke logic by building custom KServe runtime container.

**Implications**

- **RHOAI/KServe Core:** Easier management (often included/documented). May not offer peak performance for all types/hardware.
- **vLLM/OVMS/Triton (Custom):** Higher performance for specialized domains (LLMs, Intel, NVIDIA GPUs). Requires deploying/managing custom `ServingRuntime`/`ClusterServingRuntime`. May need specific hardware (GPUs for vLLM/Triton). Compatibility must be maintained.
- **Custom-Built:** Max flexibility but requires significant development/maintenance for runtime container/KServe integration.

## RHOAI-SM-37: NVIDIA NIM Serving Platform Integration

**Architectural Question**
Will NVIDIA NIM integration be enabled for the single-model serving platform in Red Hat OpenShift AI?

**Issue or Problem**
NVIDIA NIM provides optimized inference microservices for LLMs. Enabling it impacts integration complexity and hardware dependency.

**Assumption**
NVIDIA GPU acceleration is enabled (RHOAI-SM-23). Single-model serving (KServe) is enabled (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- Enable NVIDIA NIM Integration
- Rely on Standard KServe Runtime Environment (e.g., vLLM, Triton, Caikit)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable NVIDIA NIM:** Leverage NVIDIA's optimized microservices for deploying high-performance LLMs, maximizing GPU utilization for inference.
- **Rely on Standard KServe:** Use generic KServe model servers without specialized NVIDIA inference components.

**Implications**

- **Enable NVIDIA NIM:** Requires specific hardware/software configs validated by NVIDIA/Red Hat. Requires access to NIM images (NGC). Increases complexity (integrating specialized proprietary software). Requires deploying NIM as custom KServe runtime. May involve NVIDIA AI Enterprise licensing (RHOAI-SM-12).
- **Rely on Standard KServe:** Less specialized integration. Performance optimization relies on chosen model server (vLLM, Triton, Caikit) and GPU Operator config (NVIDIA-GPU-XX ADs).

## RHOAI-SM-38: Distributed Inference with LLM-D [TECH-PREVIEW]

**Architectural Question**
Will the Distributed Inference with llm-d component [TECH-PREVIEW] be used for large language model serving?

**Issue or Problem**
Serving LLMs often requires significant resources and sharding workloads across multiple nodes/GPUs, which is complex for scaling/recovery. `llm-d` aims to simplify this.

**Assumption**
LLMs requiring distributed processing (multi-GPU/multi-node) are planned for deployment via KServe (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- Enable Distributed Inference with llm-d [TECH-PREVIEW]
- Rely on Standard KServe (Single-Instance or basic scaling) Deployment

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable llm-d:** Simplify complex LLM deployments by providing capabilities for sharding workloads across multiple nodes/GPUs using this specialized framework.
- **Rely on Standard KServe:** Use default serving mechanism where model runs within single KServe instance (can use multi-GPU on one node). Suitable for models not requiring multi-node sharding.

**Implications**

- **Enable llm-d:** **Technology Preview** feature, not supported under production SLAs. Requires specific configuration in KServe `InferenceService` to use `llm-d` runtime. Adds complexity specific to this preview feature.
- **Rely on Standard KServe:** Limits size/requirements of models efficiently served from single KServe endpoint (though KServe scales replicas horizontally). Doesn't natively handle model sharding across instances.

**(Start of Monitoring & Lifecycle Section)**

## RHOAI-SM-39: Single-model serving platform (KServe) monitoring enablement

**Architectural Question**
Will monitoring be enabled for the KServe single-model serving platform?

**Issue or Problem**
Monitoring KServe `InferenceService` deployments provides visibility into request latency, throughput, success/error rates, and resource usage. Enabling it requires User Workload Monitoring (UWM). (Aligns with OCP-MON-01).

**Assumption**
Single-model serving platform (KServe) is enabled (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- Enable KServe Monitoring via UWM
- Disable KServe Monitoring

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable KServe Monitoring:** Collect metrics from served models, integrate into OpenShift Monitoring (Grafana). Crucial for understanding serving performance, identifying bottlenecks, setting alerts.
- **Disable KServe Monitoring:** Simpler deployment, reduced resource use if detailed serving metrics aren't required (rely on basic pod metrics/logs).

**Implications**

- **Enable KServe Monitoring:** Requires enabling User Workload Monitoring (UWM) in cluster (OCP-MON-01). Consumes Prometheus resources for scraping/storing KServe metrics. Provides essential MLOps observability. RHOAI typically configures KServe scraping automatically if UWM enabled.
- **Disable KServe Monitoring:** Reduces monitoring overhead. Limits visibility into model serving performance, making diagnosis/optimization harder.

## RHOAI-SM-40: NVIDIA NIM Metrics collection

**Architectural Question**
If using NVIDIA NIM, will metrics collection be enabled for NIM-based KServe deployments?

**Issue or Problem**
Monitoring NIM-specific metrics (GPU utilization, inference latency) enhances visibility but requires ensuring NIM endpoints are scraped by OpenShift Monitoring (UWM).

**Assumption**
NVIDIA NIM integration is enabled (RHOAI-SM-37). User Workload Monitoring (UWM) is enabled (OCP-MON-01 / RHOAI-SM-39).

**Alternatives**

- Enable NIM Metrics Collection
- Disable NIM Metrics Collection

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable NIM Metrics:** Detailed visibility into performance/resource consumption of NIM inference servers for troubleshooting/optimization.
- **Disable NIM Metrics:** Reduce monitoring overhead if standard KServe/pod metrics suffice.

**Implications**

- **Enable NIM Metrics:** Requires configuring `ServiceMonitor`/`PodMonitor` to target NIM metrics endpoint within KServe `InferenceService`. May need custom annotations. Consumes Prometheus resources.
- **Disable NIM Metrics:** Simplifies monitoring config but limits insight into NIM runtime behavior. Relies on higher-level KServe metrics.

## RHOAI-SM-41: TrustyAI Monitoring for Data Science Models

**Architectural Question**
Will the TrustyAI component be enabled for monitoring model fairness and explainability?

**Issue or Problem**
TrustyAI provides advanced monitoring (fairness metrics, explainability) beyond basic serving metrics. Enabling it requires deploying the TrustyAI service and integrating it with model serving runtimes.

**Assumption**
Model serving (likely KServe, RHOAI-SM-34) is enabled.

**Alternatives**

- Enable TrustyAI Service
- Disable TrustyAI Service

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable TrustyAI:** Gain insights into model fairness, identify bias, generate explanations for predictions, supporting responsible AI/compliance.
- **Disable TrustyAI:** Simpler deployment if advanced fairness/explainability monitoring aren't immediate needs (rely on standard performance metrics, RHOAI-SM-39).

**Implications**

- **Enable TrustyAI:** Requires enabling `trustyai` component in `DataScienceCluster` CR. Deploys TrustyAI operator/service pods (consumes resources). `InferenceService`s need configuration (annotations) to send prediction data to TrustyAI. Requires expertise in configuring fairness metrics/interpreting explanations.
- **Disable TrustyAI:** Reduces resource use/config complexity. Limits observability to standard operational metrics, lacking insights into bias/rationale.

## RHOAI-SM-42: Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) Backup Strategy for RHOAI

**Architectural Question**
Will backup be implemented for Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) used specifically by Red Hat OpenShift AI components (e.g., workbenches, pipeline metadata DB if internal)?

**Issue or Problem**
RHOAI workloads rely on persistent volumes for critical data (models, datasets, workbench configurations). Data loss requires a robust recovery strategy integrated with the overall platform backup approach.

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- None (Ephemeral/Recreatable Data Only)
- Integrated OCP Backup (OADP/Velero)
- Application-Specific Data Export

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **None (Ephemeral/Recreatable Data Only):** Only suitable if all persistent data used by RHOAI components (workbenches, pipelines) can be easily recreated or restored from an external source (e.g., Git, S3 bucket).
- **Integrated OCP Backup (OADP/Velero):** Leverages the OpenShift Data Protection (OADP) Operator to protect RHOAI PVCs (block or filesystem volumes) alongside the cluster configuration. This is the recommended strategy for protecting workbench data and internal databases.
- **Application-Specific Data Export:** Uses custom scripts or application-level mechanisms (e.g., internal database backup tools, model registry export) to save data to an external location (e.g., object storage).

**Implications**

- **None (Ephemeral/Recreatable Data Only):** High Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) and potential loss of intellectual property if data cannot be restored.
- **Integrated OCP Backup (OADP/Velero):** Requires configuring OADP and ensuring appropriate backup capacity. The backup must protect the RHOAI Custom Resources (e.g., DataScienceProject, Workbench CRs) in addition to the associated persistent volumes.
- **Application-Specific Data Export:** Avoids reliance on OCP storage APIs but requires significant custom maintenance and orchestration.

# OpenShift Pipelines

## PIPELINES-01: Pipeline Strategy and Scope

**Architectural Question**
What is the strategic scope and intended use case for OpenShift Pipelines within the organization?

**Issue or Problem**
A clear domain must be defined for which OpenShift Pipelines will be the standard CI tool. Different workloads, such as traditional application development and data science model training, have distinct CI/CD requirements.

**Assumption**
A CI/CD solution is required for building and deploying applications on the platform.

**Alternatives**

- Unified Pipeline Strategy
- Segregated Pipeline Strategy (Apps vs. Data Science)

**Decision**
#TODO: Document the decision for each cluster.#

**Justification**

- **Unified Pipeline Strategy:** To standardize on a single, cloud-native CI/CD tool for all workloads, simplifying the toolchain and operational knowledge required.
- **Segregated Pipeline Strategy (Apps vs. Data Science):** To use the best-fit tool for each domain. OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) is ideal for container-native application CI, while specialized tools (like Kubeflow Pipelines, part of RHOAI) are better suited for the experimental and data-centric nature of MLOps.

**Implications**

- **Unified Pipeline Strategy:** May require extensive customization of Tekton Tasks to accommodate the specific needs of data science workloads. Data science teams may face a steeper learning curve.
- **Segregated Pipeline Strategy (Apps vs. Data Science):** Establishes clear boundaries and provides purpose-built tools for each team. However, it increases the number of tools the platform team must support and requires integration points.

## PIPELINES-02: Pipeline Execution Storage (Workspaces)

**Architectural Question**
What type of storage will be used for pipeline workspaces?

**Issue or Problem**
Pipelines require storage (workspaces) to clone source code, store intermediate artifacts, and share data between tasks. The choice of storage affects performance, cost, and data persistence.

**Assumption**
OpenShift Pipelines will be deployed.

**Alternatives**

- Ephemeral Storage (emptyDir)
- Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

**Decision**
#TODO: Document the decision for each cluster.#

**Justification**

- **Ephemeral Storage (emptyDir):** Uses temporary, node-local storage (RAM or disk space) for the duration of the pipeline run. Ideal for cloning source code or storing temporary intermediate artifacts that must be shared between sequential tasks, but do not require persistence after the pipeline finishes.
- **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):** Uses persistent storage (e.g., ODF, native cloud storage) managed by a StorageClass. Necessary for tasks requiring cache volumes (e.g., dependency cache) or when outputs must be retained after the pipeline completes.

**Implications**

- **Ephemeral Storage (emptyDir):** No explicit storage consumption cost, but transient data is lost if the pod restarts or the pipeline finishes. Requires tasks to fetch dependencies anew each run.
- **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):** Incurs storage consumption costs and management overhead for the PVC lifecycle. Must ensure the underlying storage class supports the required access mode (RWO or RWX, depending on sharing needs).

## PIPELINES-03: Pipeline Triggering Mechanism

**Architectural Question**
How will pipelines be initiated?

**Issue or Problem**
A strategy is needed to determine how pipelines are triggered. This affects the level of automation, integration with source control, and enabling event-driven workflows.

**Assumption**
OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) will be used for CI/CD automation.

**Alternatives**

- Manual Triggering (CLI/Console)
- Git Webhooks via Tekton Triggers
- GitOps/ArgoCD Synchronization

**Decision**
#TODO: Document the decision for each cluster.#

**Justification**

- **Manual Triggering (CLI/Console):** Simplest implementation, suitable for early development or troubleshooting, requiring no external integration setup.
- **Git Webhooks via Tekton Triggers:** To enable event-driven CI/CD, automatically running pipelines (Builds, Tests) immediately upon source code changes (e.g., git push, pull request open).
- **GitOps/ArgoCD Synchronization:** To enforce a declarative deployment state, allowing the GitOps tool to manage the continuous execution of promotion or synchronization pipelines.

**Implications**

- **Manual Triggering (CLI/Console):** Lack of automation results in manual operational overhead for application release management.
- **Git Webhooks via Tekton Triggers:** Requires securing and managing webhook secrets and configuration, ensuring the cluster is reachable by the Git provider, or leveraging internal Git server integrations.
- **GitOps/ArgoCD Synchronization:** Requires defining pipelines that operate based on repository state rather than transient events. This aligns with GitOps principles but may not support rapid CI/test cycles.

## PIPELINES-04: Pipelines as Code (PaC) Adoption Strategy

**Architectural Question**
What strategy will be adopted for defining and executing CI/CD workflows using OpenShift Pipelines?

**Issue or Problem**
CI/CD pipelines should be managed declaratively alongside application source code to facilitate GitOps principles and version control of the entire development and deployment process.

**Assumption**
OpenShift Pipelines will be deployed.

**Alternatives**

- Manual Definition of Tekton Resources
- Pipelines as Code (PaC) Integration

**Decision**
#TODO: Document the decision.#

**Justification**

- **Manual Definition of Tekton Resources:** To define and apply `Pipeline` and `PipelineRun` resources directly to the cluster, typically via CLI commands or application manifests. This offers maximum control but lacks the Git integration benefits of PaC.
- **Pipelines as Code (PaC) Integration:** To leverage repository webhooks and in-line comments to trigger and manage Tekton pipelines directly from the Git repository, aligning the CI/CD definition closely with the application source code.

**Implications**

- **Manual Definition of Tekton Resources:** Requires external orchestration (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to manage pipeline runs, increasing complexity.
- **Pipelines as Code (PaC) Integration:** Requires configuring webhooks on the source control system and deployment of the specialized PaC components within the cluster.
